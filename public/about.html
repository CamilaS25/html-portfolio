<h1>About Me | Who am I?!</h1>
<p>Who am I? Honestly, I'm soo much things, personalities, hobbies, places, feelings... I cannot describe myself in a single paragraph, phrase or word. We're all part of everything, but we don't want to start philosophizing right now, so let me introduce you to my life. </p>

<p> I'm a creative person that loves learn new things and tools to capture my ideas. In this case, you're seeing one of them and it's coding to creat such a great page! I'm also a little more rigid, and I studied Industrial Chemestry a few years ago and worked in two of the most important chain company in Latin America. However, I understood that the world and works can have a lot of faces that it's a continue learning so I enrolled in a new work. Actually, I'm impressed to see how this "multitask" personality is increasing in the world! So, being part of this change and challenge is very funny, awesome, and hard. </p>

<p>I'm from Colombia and I've estudied since psychology, chemestry until programming. I also love sports! I actually trained basketball, voleibal and skate, and I would love to become on a Roller. Another thing you'd like to know about me is that I looove cats! In the future, I'll talk more about my lovely and beautiful Emma. </p>

<p>Well, now you know a little bit more about me with this mouth opener, and to be honest, I'm still learing and getting to know myself a little more so, I'll make sure to keep you updates if something new comes! </p>
